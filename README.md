Microsoft-Edge-Point-EASY: An App that Gets Points in Microsoft Edge

Hi everyone!

If you want to quickly earn points from Microsoft Edge, I’m sharing an app that will do this for you. Please note that you can only earn 90 points per day using this app.

As you can see, I’ve already earned 90/90 points today, so I can’t earn any more points.

If the app doesn’t work, you might need to change some settings. Please find the EDGE application and open its properties.

In the properties window, you will see something like "Target". Please copy this and change the file location as shown below:

python
app = "{target}"
Greetings! Enjoy your points, everyone! :P
